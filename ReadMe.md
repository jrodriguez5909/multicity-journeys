> **âš  NOTE:** Before buying flights always be sure to visit your desired journey's URL under the **`kayak_search_url`** column to doublecheck prices. 

**[Please read my Medium article on this app](https://medium.com/@june.rodriguez/finding-an-optimal-flight-journey-using-selenium-b021df54f64b)** for a more detailed walkthrough.
